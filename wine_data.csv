412,France,"Under the control of the winemaking team of Lafite, this estate is on a roll. This is a beautifully balanced wine, with complexity, richness and cassis, figs and black plums.

414,France,"Delicacy and charm often seem to be the hallmarks of Angludetâ€”positive virtues in a world full of alcoholic, powerful wines.

415,France,"A stunning modern cellar has been constructed at this property owned by Marie-Laure Lurton.

416,France,"The high proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon in this vineyard (65%) paid off in the ripeness of 2003. This is a powerful, very ripe wine, full of sunshine. Wood flavors support the big black fruit. If it lacks the complexity of its succeeding vintage, this 2003 makes up with its openness and generosity. Imported by France Wine.",,89,,Bordeaux,Médoc,Nouvelle_Aquitaine,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château les Ormes Sorbet

418,France,"Under the ownership of Patrick Bernard (same family as the owners of Domaine de Chevalier), this is an up-and-coming estate that makes fine wines.

422,France,"Partly owned by New York resident Peter M. F. Sichel, this is a property that has considerably improved. This 2003 has richness, some good new wood flavors and and an open character.

426,France,"A taut, firm wine, with ripe but dry tannins and layers of acidity.

429,France,"A small, 17-acre property near Saint-Laurent in the north of Medoc, this is a classic Bordeaux, with its tight tannins, layers of dryness and acidity.

431,France,"Shines with elegance and class right from the start of the toasty, yeasty, appley bouquet with vanilla hints.

A great example of how far wines designated Kosher have come, and what is possible in this category.",L-P Brut,91,40,Champagne,Champagne,Grand_Est,Champagne Blend,Laurent-Perrier
432,France,"An elegant grand cru whose tannic structure is just beginning to resolve. Has a nose of berry aromas, earthy accents and even meaty notes.

435,France,"One of the group of estates owned by Jean-Michel Lapalu (the others include Liversan), this is a relatively soft wine, but one with good ripe fruits.

437,France,"A soft wine that has easy but attractively ripe fruit. This is not a wine for aging, but in 2003, the estate has made a very drinkable wine.

440,France,"Bright cherry and cedary aromas open to a soft mouthfeel and tart blackberry flavors with black toast shadings.

444,France,"A voluptuous blockbuster in the style we are becoming accustomed to from über-consultant Michel Rolland: big, deeply fruited (black cherries) and plush, with elegantly etched spice shadings from new oak. The tannins are supple but substantial; it should age for a long time.

449,France,"Impressive dark purple in color, this powerful vin carries lots of toasted-oak aromas: menthol and cedar in particular. There's some promising dark fruit underneath it all that should emerge in a couple years' time. Less exciting than this winery's 1996, which leads to the question: could the creation of a luxury cuvée have had an effect on the quality of this wine?",,87,20,Southwest France,Cahors,Occitanie,Red Blend,Château Lagrézette

452,France,"Dark earth and tobacco spice the aromas of this grand cru, followed by flavors of black cherries and herbs.

453,France,"A négociant bottling from the ubiquitous Yvon Mau, this wine proudly boasts élevé en futs du chene on the label.

455,France,"A solid claret, with cherry and plum fruit accented by dried herbs and a touch of vanilla.

459,France,"Another Cahors from the stable of Alain-Dominque Perrin, this one is the entry-level wine, made to be more accessible than his flagship wine from Château Lagrezette or the luxury cuvée.

462,France,"From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit.

466,France,"I know Bordeaux isn't known for being fruit-driven, but this paucity of fruit in a wine that's 50% Merlot (from a vintage that favored this variety's development) is hard to fathom.

473,France,"This lovely wine, a Monopole, is already showing complex, forward fruit with flavors of plum, cherry and cranberry. Soft and fulsome, it shows a light hand with the oak, allowing nuances of tobacco and leather to emerge. Good weight and texture, it seems bound for early glory.",Clos des Reas,93,65,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,Bourgogne_Franche_Comte,Pinot Noir,Michel Gros
474,France,"Rion holds back on the new oak, letting the pure, supple fruit speak for itself. This is a muscular Vosne, young and firm, showing excellent focus and structure.

Should cellar well for a decade or more.",Les Beaux-Monts,92,52,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,Bourgogne_Franche_Comte,Pinot Noir,Daniel Rion
475,France,"Another premier cru from Michel Gros, this one not as elegant and fruity as the Réas. Instead it goes for more ripeness, more tannic weight, and a lot more roasted scents from the barrels.

476,France,"This is a lovely, fragrant Burgundy, with a smoky/cherry scented nose leading into a rather tight, hard young wine. Hints of rosewater, graham cracker and tobacco are there, along with some green tannins. Medium body and texture; needs more time to show its best stuff.",Clos dea Argillieres,89,52,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,Bourgogne_Franche_Comte,Pinot Noir,Daniel Rion
477,France,"Scents of graham cracker and malted milk chocolate tickle the nose, while the tart fruit slowly unwinds to reveal cherry and beetroot scents and flavors. Tannic and hard, without immediately showing much sweetness, it seems to put the emphasis on mineral and soil, root and leaf, but may evolve into a very interesting wine.",,89,38,Burgundy,Chambolle-Musigny,Bourgogne_Franche_Comte,Pinot Noir,Michel Gros
478,France,"This needs a good bit of breathing time, then it begins to reveal some cherry lifesaver fruit and a balanced structure with firm acids and medium tannins.

479,France,"The nose is dominated by the attractive scents of new French oak, with some hints of pipe tobacco and just a whiff of volatile acidity.

480,France,"Inky and rustic, yet in a refined manner. This is knock-out juice if you like â€™em big and flavorful. The full bouquet of grape, raisin, oak, licorice and herb aromas pulls you in and the follow-up palate of dense blackberry flavors with herb and smoke shadings fulfills the promise the nose makes. Loads of oak here, but thereâ€™s great depth of fruit for it to play against. A definite keeper; hold for three or four years at least.",,94,30,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Nouvelle_Aquitaine,Rhône-style Red Blend,Le Vieux Donjon

482,France,"Jacquart makes a full-bodied, ripe style of Champagne, with tiny, effusive bubbles. Flavors of slightly overripe apples lead into a mature palate with hints of oxidation.

483,France,"This classy example opens with a very floral nose and almost flower-shop aromas. But itâ€™s not at all sweet on the palate, as tangy lime quickly moves to the fore. Impressively light and elegant, it displays some unusual elements and has a fine bead as well as a supple, herb-tinged finish.",Cuvée President,91,37,Champagne,Champagne,Grand_Est,Champagne Blend,H.Germain
484,France,"Shows some older notes: a bouquet of toasted white bread, cinnamon, brown sugar and smoky yeast, with just the slightest hint of white pepper.

Should continue to age and grow finer.",Blanc de Blancs Brut Mosaà¯que,91,38,Champagne,Champagne,Grand_Est,Champagne Blend,Jacquart
485,France,"Rich and toasty, with tiny bubbles. The bouquet is laced with honey and vanilla scents. The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. Thereâ€™s good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though itâ€™s probably not the best choice for oysters.",Demi-Sec,91,30,Champagne,Champagne,Grand_Est,Champagne Blend,Jacquart
486,France,"Really fine for a low-acid vintage, there's an intriguing nose here with white pepper, sandalwood and pine-nut elements. There are mature notes to the apple, toast and pepper flavors, good backbone, and the texture is just lovely. This well-developed example still has youthful elements, and closes with a grapefruit-mineral finish that is both relaxed and complex.",Diamant Bleu,91,70,Champagne,Champagne,Grand_Est,Champagne Blend,Heidsieck & Co Monopole
487,France,"Offers an intriguing nose with ginger, lime and floral elements. The mouthfeel is ephemeralâ€”almost too lightâ€”but thereâ€™s a good case to be made for this style when bubbles are involved. Green apple, an almost lilac note, and lime on the palate. Finishes nicely, too.",Cuvée Prestige,91,27,Champagne,Champagne,Grand_Est,Champagne Blend,H.Germain
488,France,"A perfect salmon shade, with scents of peaches, cherries and toast. It hits the palate with big, ripe, fresh fruit: crisp apples, peaches, cherries and citrus.
